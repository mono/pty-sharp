This is some bits from libzvt CVS extracted to make a more-or-less standalone
gnome-pty-helper kit.  Presumably it is licensed under the LGPL, as libzvt
itself is.

Note that for utmp/wtmp/lastlog logging to work properly, you *must* ensure
that gnome-pty-helper is installed with the correct permissions.  By default,
gnome-pty-helper is installed setgid "utmp".  If your system does not have a
group named "utmp" (or if this group does not have write access to the
corresponding log files), then it will probably need to be made setuid "root".
