This library provides a managed binding to create Unix
pseudo-terminals (ptys) using Mono on a variety of operating systems.

It uses the vte code to create pseudo terminals and the
gnome-pty-helper program to provide proper login and pseudo terminal
creation (turned off by default, by default it tries to use a
system-provided gnome-pty-helper).

The API is in pty-sharp.dll in the Unix.PseudoTerminal namespace.
